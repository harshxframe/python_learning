# typecasting a way by which we can convert value in required datatype from which ti is, But conddtion but be valid



a = "34";
b = type(a) # to check the type of variable
converted = float(a) # by using this way you can use float, int ,str etc for value type casting.
x =34
ans = converted + x

print(ans) # example the type casting work.
print(b) # how the type showing data type
