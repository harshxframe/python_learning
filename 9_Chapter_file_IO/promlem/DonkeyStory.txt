In a quiet village, a stubborn ####### named Coco caused chaos every morning.
The ####### refused to move unless it was fed carrots, and the villagers gave in.
One day, a traveler arrived with a cart, but the ####### blocked the road.
“Whose ####### is this?” he asked. “That’s the village’s alarm clock,”
laughed a boy. The traveler tried to bribe the ####### with apples.
No luck. Only carrots worked. From then on,
he carried carrots everywhere. The ####### became famous,
and tourists came just to see the clever ####### who controlled an entire village’s morning routine.
